## Route Overview

This section categorizes the API endpoints into Admin and User routes. Each endpoint is listed with the HTTP method, route path, any required middleware for authentication, the corresponding controller function that handles the request, and a brief description of its functionality. The Admin routes are primarily for managing the applicationâ€™s critical data and operations, while the User routes handle both public actions and authenticated user operations.

## Authentication Middleware

The `authMiddleware` function is utilized to protect sensitive routes. Replace `"admin"` or `"user"` within the middleware to specify the required user role needed to access the endpoint.

---

## Error Middleware

The error middleware is implemented to handle errors that occur during route processing. The middleware is automatically triggered when an error is thrown in the application.

---

## Usage

1. Ensure all controllers and middleware are properly imported and exported.
2. Import and mount these routes in your main server file.
3. Secure the API by configuring the authentication middleware as required.
4. Test the routes using Postman or a similar tool.

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Start the server using `"npx nodemon --exec "ts-node src/server.ts"`.

## Conclusion

This documentation summarizes the routing mechanism for the API. The routes are categorized based on user roles and provide a clear overview of the functionalities available in the application. For further details, refer to the individual controller functions and middleware implementations.
